# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Every piece of stored information must encode predictive value about future actions, decisions, or understanding — if it doesn't change behavior, it's noise, and the system actively manages this boundary.
**Current focus:** v1.0 complete — awaiting v2.0 milestone definition

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.0 (shipped 2026-02-22)
Status: Complete — all 3 phases, 11 plans, 45 requirements delivered
Next: Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v2.0

Progress: [██████████] 100% (11/11 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics
