# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-03)

**Core value:** Every piece of stored information must encode predictive value about future actions, decisions, or understanding — if it doesn't change behavior, it's noise, and the system actively manages this boundary.
**Current focus:** Phase 9 — Python Training Infrastructure

## Current Position

Milestone: v3.0 Local AI + Polish
Phase: 9 of 12 (Python Training Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-03 — v3.0 roadmap created, phases 9-12 defined

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v3.0 scope)

## Accumulated Context

### From v2.0
- 3-Ring Binder tiered pipeline foundation exists (Tier 1 deterministic, Tier 2 ONNX centroids, Tier 3 LLM)
- Embedding worker with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 already running
- Classification log in Dexie for pattern learning already wired
- Tech debt items identified and carried forward for cleanup

### Decisions (v3.0 kickoff)

- Classifier head is a separate ONNX MLP (~200-400KB) consuming MiniLM 384-dim embeddings — not a full fine-tuned transformer. Reuses existing embedding worker.
- Section routing uses nearest-neighbor (not fine-tuned model) — sections are user-specific dynamic labels, no shared model can cover them.
- `modelSuggestion` field added to ClassificationEvent schema in Phase 9, before classifier ships in Phase 10. Retrofitting after production data is costly.
- Phase 10 browser integration can start with placeholder ONNX (random-weight export) to validate worker wiring independently of Phase 9 training timeline.
- Confidence threshold for `classify-type` starts at 0.78 (not current 0.65) — requires one empirical calibration iteration after first model is trained.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 9]: 0.78 confidence threshold is a research estimate — measure escalation rate on held-out set and adjust before Phase 10 integration.
- [Phase 9]: decision/insight boundary is hardest classification pair. If calibrated accuracy below 65%, consider collapsing to single class with secondary UI selection.
- [Phase 10]: Production COOP/COEP header configuration must be verified against actual hosting environment — COEP `credentialless` is correct but environment-specific.

### Pending Todos

None yet.
