# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-22)

**Core value:** Every piece of stored information must encode predictive value about future actions, decisions, or understanding — if it doesn't change behavior, it's noise, and the system actively manages this boundary.
**Current focus:** v2.0 AI Orchestration — Phase 4: AI Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 7 (AI Infrastructure)
Plan: — of 3 in Phase 4
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-22 — v2.0 roadmap created (Phases 4–7, 30/30 requirements mapped)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 30% (v1.0 complete; v2.0 Phase 4 next)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: 14 min
- Total execution time: ~156 min

**By Phase (v1.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 4/4 | 90 min | 23 min |
| 2. Compute Engine | 3/3 | 33 min | 11 min |
| 3. Pages/Nav/Search | 4/4 | 33 min | 8 min |

*v2.0 metrics will populate as phases complete*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: Tiered LLM — SmolLM2 via Transformers.js for classification; Anthropic cloud API for conversational reviews
- [v2.0]: Dedicated llm-worker.ts separate from BinderCore worker — prevents OOM crashes and unblocks atom mutations during inference
- [v2.0]: GSD-style question flows as core AI interaction pattern (3-4 options + freeform)
- [v2.0]: Floating orb is the single AI entry point; AI mutations are additive, tagged, reversible
- [v2.0]: Phases 6 and 7 flagged for research before planning (review session schema; GTD question flow design)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Build]: pnpm build:wasm requires LIB env var set to MSVC + Windows SDK paths on Windows
- [Phase 6]: Dexie schema for branching review session state needs design work before planning
- [Phase 7]: GTD question flow design (specific questions per phase, preventing Get Creative from becoming open-ended chat) needs deliberate design work before planning
