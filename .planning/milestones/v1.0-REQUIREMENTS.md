# Requirements Archive: v1.0

**Defined:** 2026-02-21
**Completed:** 2026-02-22
**Core Value:** Every piece of stored information must encode predictive value about future actions, decisions, or understanding — if it doesn't change behavior, it's noise, and the system actively manages this boundary.

## v1.0 Requirements — All Complete

### Data Model (6/6)

- [x] **DATA-01**: User can create atoms of exactly five types: Task, Fact, Event, Decision, Insight
- [x] **DATA-02**: Every atom has an ID, type, created_at, updated_at, links array, and status
- [x] **DATA-03**: Atom type is mandatory — system never persists an untyped atom outside the inbox
- [x] **DATA-04**: Atom content supports Markdown formatting
- [x] **DATA-05**: Atoms are stored in IndexedDB via Dexie.js with enforced schema (Zod validation)
- [x] **DATA-06**: Atom schema evolves only via explicit migrations

### Capture & Inbox (6/6)

- [x] **CAPT-01**: User can quick-capture an item to the inbox via keyboard shortcut from any view
- [x] **CAPT-02**: Inbox has a hard cap (configurable, default 20)
- [x] **CAPT-03**: When inbox is full, system presents resolution UI
- [x] **CAPT-04**: Inbox items must be classified before becoming atoms
- [x] **CAPT-05**: Open tasks have a hard cap (configurable, default 30)
- [x] **CAPT-06**: Soft warning at 80%, hard block at 100%

### Organization (9/9)

- [x] **ORG-01**: Four stable sections: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive
- [x] **ORG-02**: User can create, rename, and archive items within sections
- [x] **ORG-03**: Pages are query definitions over the atom store
- [x] **ORG-04**: Default pages: Today, This Week, Active Projects, Waiting, Insights
- [x] **ORG-05**: User can filter atom lists by type, status, date range, section, priority
- [x] **ORG-06**: User can sort atom lists by date, priority score, last updated, staleness
- [x] **ORG-07**: Tasks have status: open, in-progress, waiting, done, cancelled
- [x] **ORG-08**: Tasks support due date and scheduled date; Events are dated
- [x] **ORG-09**: UI follows binder metaphor: sidebar, tabs, main pane

### Entropy Engine (10/10)

- [x] **ENTR-01**: Priority score computed dynamically: P = f(deadline, importance, recency, dependencies, energy)
- [x] **ENTR-02**: Priority scoring runs in Rust/WASM in Web Worker
- [x] **ENTR-03**: Staleness decay reduces relevance unless touched, linked, or pinned
- [x] **ENTR-04**: Each atom displays a visual staleness indicator
- [x] **ENTR-05**: Entropy health indicator visible on every view
- [x] **ENTR-06**: Entropy score = f(open tasks, stale items, zero-link atoms, inbox length)
- [x] **ENTR-07**: Link density tracked per atom
- [x] **ENTR-08**: System surfaces compression prompt candidates
- [x] **ENTR-09**: Compression prompts offer archive, delete, or keep
- [x] **ENTR-10**: Entropy enforcement is advisory-first

### Navigation & Search (7/7)

- [x] **NAV-01**: Full-text search across all atom types with ranked results
- [x] **NAV-02**: Search supports filtering by type, status, date range
- [x] **NAV-03**: Full keyboard navigation
- [x] **NAV-04**: Command palette via keyboard shortcut
- [x] **NAV-05**: Backlinks visible on each atom
- [x] **NAV-06**: User can add tags to atoms
- [x] **NAV-07**: User can create and save custom filter definitions

### Trust & Safety (7/7)

- [x] **TRST-01**: System operates fully offline
- [x] **TRST-02**: User can export all data as JSON and Markdown
- [x] **TRST-03**: All mutations logged in append-only changelog
- [x] **TRST-04**: User can undo recent changes
- [x] **TRST-05**: System requests persistent storage at first launch
- [x] **TRST-06**: Storage persistence status visible in UI
- [x] **TRST-07**: All data stored locally, never leaves device unless exported
