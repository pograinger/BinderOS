# Milestone v1.0: Foundation + Compute Engine + Pages/Navigation/Search

**Shipped:** 2026-02-22
**Commits:** 52
**Plans:** 11/11 complete
**Requirements:** 45/45 complete
**Execution Time:** ~156 min total

## Overview

BinderOS v1.0 delivers a complete local-first personal information management system with typed atoms, entropy-driven scoring, and full navigation/search. Three phases shipped in sequence: data foundation, Rust/WASM compute engine, and the page/search/filter surface.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Local-first typed atom system** — Five atom types (Task, Fact, Event, Decision, Insight) with Zod-validated schema, IndexedDB persistence via Dexie, CRDT-compatible changelog, and JSON/Markdown export
2. **Rust/WASM compute engine** — Priority scoring (5-weight formula), staleness decay (14-day half-life), entropy health indicator, and compression candidate surfacing — all off main thread
3. **Advisory-first cap enforcement** — Inbox (20) and task (30) hard caps with 80% soft warnings and resolution UI (classify, schedule, discard, merge)
4. **Query-based pages** — Today, This Week, Active Projects, Waiting, Insights as reactive queries over the atom store, not data silos
5. **Full keyboard navigation** — Command palette (Ctrl+P), search overlay (Ctrl+K), roving tabindex, number-key page switching, shortcut reference
6. **Cross-cutting organization** — Tags, backlinks, @mention inline linking, saved filter persistence, FilterBar on all views

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (4 plans, 90 min)
**Goal:** Users can create, classify, and persist typed atoms in a durable local store, with a binder UI shell that won't silently lose data

Plans:
- 01-01: Project scaffolding — Vite + SolidJS + TypeScript + Rust/WASM pipeline + Worker bridge
- 01-02: Atom schema + IndexedDB — Zod schemas, Dexie database, write queue, changelog, export
- 01-03: Worker handlers + shell — Command dispatch, SolidJS reactive store, dark theme layout, status bar
- 01-04: Views + capture — Card-by-card triage, fast capture overlay, voice capture, swipe gestures

Requirements: DATA-01–06, TRST-01–07, ORG-01, ORG-02, ORG-09, CAPT-01

### Phase 2: Compute Engine (3 plans, 33 min)
**Goal:** Every atom has a live priority score and staleness indicator, entropy health is visible, and caps enforce hygiene

Plans:
- 02-01: Rust/WASM scoring engine — compute_scores, compute_entropy, filter_compression_candidates
- 02-02: Visualization + cap enforcement — PriorityBadge, staleness opacity, CapEnforcementModal
- 02-03: ReviewView — Compression prompt triage with Archive/Delete/Keep/Merge actions

Requirements: ENTR-01–10, CAPT-02–06

### Phase 3: Pages, Navigation, and Search (4 plans, 33 min)
**Goal:** Users can navigate the full system by keyboard, find any atom via search, and organize with tags and filters

Plans:
- 03-01: Schema migration + query engine — Dexie v2, query functions, FilterBar, savedFilters
- 03-02: Default pages + atom detail — 5 page views, AtomDetailView, useRovingTabindex
- 03-03: Search + command palette — MiniSearch, semantic embeddings, CommandPalette, ShortcutReference
- 03-04: Tags + backlinks + saved filters — TagInput, BacklinksPanel, @mention, filter persistence

Requirements: ORG-03–08, NAV-01–07

## UAT Results

Phase 3 UAT: 23/23 tests passed (03-UAT.md)
Milestone audit: passed (v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md)

## Technical Patterns Established

- Worker-owned WASM (UI never imports WASM directly)
- Typed Command/Response message bridge
- Write queue with 300ms debounce + flushImmediate
- CRDT-compatible changelog (lamport clock + device ID)
- createMemo for all derived signals
- reconcile() for structural state updates
- Advisory-first cap enforcement (soft warning → hard block)
- Higher-order filteredAndSortedAtoms() for composable filtering
